# Asset Bot

This is a bot that offers commands to see various Naomi assets right on Discord - art, emotes, game screenshots, and outfits.

> **Warning**
> While the assets are displayed for your reference (such as for fan art), the assets still belong to Naomi. Please do not redistribute or repurpose them.
